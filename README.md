This project is a beginner-level image classification system built using TensorFlow and trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It demonstrates a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that classifies images into one of ten categories, including cat, dog, car, airplane, and others. The model is trained over multiple epochs and evaluated on test data to achieve around 68% accuracy. In addition to training and evaluation, the project includes visualization tools such as accuracy and loss plots to track performance over time, sample image predictions to compare actual versus predicted labels, and a confusion matrix to analyze classification errors in detail. The trained model is saved as a .h5 file for future use or deployment. This project is ideal for those starting out with deep learning and computer vision. To run the project, users can install dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file and execute the script using Python. The structure is clean, lightweight, and easy to understand, making it suitable for educational and demonstration purposes.
